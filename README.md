# Sigmoid-function-in-assembly
~~Made on MIPS using MARS~~

About the function:
- It takes an array of values and compute the sigmoid (element-wise)
- It approximate exp(-x) using taylor's series
- The number of factors for the approximation can be changed
- The size of the array to compute can be of any size
- It works on single digit precision
